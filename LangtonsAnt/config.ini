//examples for instructionset:
//RL				Base instruction set, highway after 11000 steps
//RLR				Totally "random", chaotic growth
//LLRR				Grow symetrically
//RLLR				Extends its square walls
//LRRRL				Extremely slow square
//LRRRRRLLR			Fills the space around itself in a square
//LRLRLRLRLRR		Very fast highway
//LLRRRLRLRLLR		Creates a convoluted highway
//RRLLLRLLLRRR		Creates a filled triangle that grows
//RN				2 way binary counter, sort of
